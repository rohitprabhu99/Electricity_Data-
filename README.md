Some analysis on the Our World in Data energy dataset (ongoing project).

The analysis.py code includes:

1. A pie chart showing the proportion of global electricity produced from each generation source (Generation_method.png)

2. Code to extract the proportion of electricity (produced by each country/region) that is a) low-carbon and b) produced by either nuclear or hydropower. I also plot scatter graph to visualise the correlation between these two variables (Nuclear+hydro.png)
